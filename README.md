# pwa-to-apk-action-test
This repository contains files generated by bubblewrap-cli which will be used in [awsm-pwa-to-apk-action](https://github.com/sharadcodes/awsm-pwa-to-apk-action), it's a one time process, I'll automate this step further so that you only have to push to your web app and the project along with apk get's generated automatically, currently only apk generation is automated. Well it was kind of hassel to figure out
